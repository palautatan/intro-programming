    "<font color='navy'>*The following two chunks contain advanced material*. The code in these chunks pulls information from the webpage linked above. When you pull information off of a website using code, it is called **webscraping**. Webscraping is often used to pull data from the internet and make your own dataset. Webscraping is associated with another skill called **natural language processing (NLP)**. We won't be doing any NLP in this lesson, but it good to know what it is. Some of the things you can do with NLP are (1) analyzing whether tweets are seemingly liberal or conservative or (2) checking whether it is the same person posting Facebook statuses under a certain account. For example, a social media manager or the actual account owner may be posting. Anyway, the following two chunks have to do with webscraping and not quite NLP. Read the comments to follow along what the code is doing. Do not try to \"memorize\" it.</font>"
